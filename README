OCaml Count-Min Sketch
----------------------

Most of the documentation can be found in cminsketch.mli.  Here are
some basic instructions for building:

    ocamlbuild .docdir/index.html       # get the docs
    ocamlbuild test.native              # to run the test script

The library needs OCaml Batteries Included <http://batteries.forge.ocamlcore.org/>
To run the test script, you will need ocamlgsl <http://oandrieu.nerim.net/ocaml/gsl/>.
If you are on Ubuntu, these correspond to the ocaml-batteries-included
and libocamlgsl-ocaml-dev packages.
