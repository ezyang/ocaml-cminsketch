OCaml Count-Min Sketch
----------------------

Most of the documentation can be found in cminsketch.mli.  Here are
some basic instructions for building:

    ocamlbuild .docdir/index.html       # get the docs
    ocamlbuild cminsketch.native        # get a silly incomplete test script

You will need Batteries Included <http://batteries.forge.ocamlcore.org/>.
